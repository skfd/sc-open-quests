# Design

Status: dos and don'ts drawn from the prior-art survey, discussed 2026-10-11. Decisions below are agreed.

## The one idea

Count what the app would show. Each number on the site should be "how many quests of type T a StreetComplete
user standing in city C would see, with default settings, on app version V". Each knob that moves that number
is recorded alongside it.

## Do

- **Take filters from the app's build, not from reading its source.**
  - 21 filter strings splice in Kotlin constants, so a regex over the source gets them wrong.
  - Run SC's own registry, either through a small JVM harness next to `PrintQuestFiltersAsOverpassQL` that
    prints each resolved `elementFilter` in SC syntax, or by evaluating with SC's Kotlin directly.
  - Pin the SC release tag (v63.4 today) and store it on every snapshot.
- **Stamp each snapshot with the three knobs:**
  - SC version.
  - Resurvey multiplier: the app's user setting of 0.5, 1 or 2 (proposed default 1).
  - Whether the 34 default-disabled quests are counted.
- **Classify every quest from the code, not by hand.**
  - The 138 `OsmFilterQuestType` (v63.4) start as *supported*.
  - The 51 custom quests start as *unsupported*.
  - A custom quest moves up to *approximated* or *supported* only when someone writes its logic and checks it
    against the app.
  - Show the class on the site.
- **Split the aging signal from the mapping signal by using the filter itself.**
  - The 48 quests whose filters use `older` can reopen with no edit at all.
  - For those, record the count from the plain tag test and the count that only exists because the element
    or check_date has aged, separately.
- **Apply country gating for Canada and Ontario** (`enabledInCountries`, 27 quests; codes include subdivisions such as CA-ON). Leaving it out
  overcounts.
- **Count by the quest's center point inside the real city polygon.** This matches the app (`OsmQuestController`
  creates a quest only if its center is inside the downloaded area) and avoids starsep's bounding-box
  overcount.
- **Take boundaries from `ontario-farmland`.** Toronto is relation 324211 at admin_level **6**; other cities
  are at 8. Configure cities by relation id, not by admin level.
- **Store denominators beside counts:** element count per quest's base selector, road km, land area from
  `areas.json`.
- **Read the extract from the shared store, don't download it.** `../osm-extracts` owns the Geofabrik
  download into `~/Code/.osm-data` (`OSM_DATA_DIR`). The run calls `osm_extracts.py fetch ontario`, then
  opens the dated file named by `ontario/latest.json` and records its name and sha256 with the snapshot.
- **Reuse the sibling plumbing:**
  - Skip the run when `latest.json`'s `source_last_modified` hasn't changed, so reruns change nothing.
  - One row per day, rewritten if run again the same day.
  - Static JSON under `docs/` served by Pages, published by `run.py update`.
- **Rely on extract timestamps.** Checked 2026-10-11: Geofabrik's public Ontario PBF keeps `version` and
  `timestamp` and strips `uid` and `changeset`. That covers what `older` needs.
- **Adding a city is a line of config.**

## Don't

- Don't hand-write Overpass queries, and don't take filters from the OSM wiki's Turbo links (#2072). They
  drift and some are wrong.
- Don't use ohsome as the engine. Its filter language can't express regex, numbers, dates or element age,
  and v1 dies 2026-11-30. At most, use it to backfill history for the plain key/value quests.
- Don't silently approximate. A quest counted with simplified logic says so on the page.
- Don't compare raw counts across cities on the default view; normalize first.
- Don't mix runs from different SC versions or settings in one line without marking the break.
- Don't treat open OSM notes as noise. The app hides a quest whose center sits exactly on an open note.
  Modelled since 2026-10-12 (see "Notes" below).
- Don't schedule at 12:00 or 12:30; the sibling trackers already use those slots.
- Don't stall on the 51 custom quests. Ship the filter quests first.

## Decisions (agreed 2026-10-11)

- **Engine: Kotlin on the JVM, using SC's own filter code.** No port of the grammar. SC is a pinned
  dependency (or source checkout at a release tag). The first task is a spike that confirms `commonMain`
  `ElementFilterExpression` runs on a plain JVM, reading the PBF with a JVM library (e.g. osm4j or
  GeoDesk). Python stays an option for glue only if it earns its place.
- **Headline counts use app defaults:** resurvey multiplier 1, default-disabled quests excluded from totals
  but still computed and stored, so the site can offer a toggle.
- **Hosting:** Windows Task Scheduler on the owner's machine plus static JSON in `docs/` on GitHub Pages,
  same as toronto-streets-osm. Run slot away from 12:00/12:30, e.g. 13:15.
- **Outreach: nobody yet.** Build the Toronto milestone, then contact starsep, the SC devs and jmizv with
  something to show.

## Spike result (2026-10-11)

- **The engine works without patches.** 26 SC v63.4 `commonMain` files are vendored byte-for-byte by
  `engine/sync-sc.ps1`, which records sha256s in `SC-VERSION.txt`. They compile on a plain JVM with Kotlin
  2.4.0 and kotlinx-datetime 0.8.0, the same versions SC uses.
- **PBF reading:** `osmpbf` protobuf classes with our own three-stage parallel decoder. One full Ontario pass
  takes about 9 s, with a 9–10 GB peak heap and about 132.6M nodes indexed.
- **Cross-checked against pyosmium:** AddBenchBackrest (2,931) and AddBusStopShelter (3,719, which uses
  `older`) matched exactly in the Toronto polygon.
- **Filters come from the build:** `tools/sc-harness` dumps all 190 quests to `data/quests/v63.4.json`, and
  all 138 filter strings re-parse.
- **Semantics to remember:**
  - Date filters use the system time zone. Pin `-Duser.timezone=America/Toronto`.
  - **"Today" must be the extract's replication timestamp, not the wall clock.** The spike used the
    wall-clock date, 2026-10-11, against a 2026-07-16 extract. That miscounts the 48 `older` quests, and a
    rerun of the same extract on another day would change the counts.
    - The vendored `util/ktx/Instant.kt` calls `Clock.System.now()` directly. That's the one place vendoring
      has to deviate: add a settable clock, and have `sync-sc.ps1` apply it as a recorded patch.
    - The same lesson as toronto-streets-osm: "date a row by its extract".
  - `tag older X` is also true when the *element* hasn't been edited since X, so element age counts as well
    as check dates.
- **Known approximations** still to replace (the first two are fixed in milestone 1, below):
  - Way centres are a plain average of their nodes, not SC's centroid or midpoint.
  - Relation centres ignore sub-relations; 776 Ontario relations got no centre.
  - Notes aren't modelled.
- **Licence:** the engine is a GPL-3.0 derivative, so this repo needs a GPL-compatible licence.

## Engine (milestone 1, 2026-10-11)

What changed since the spike (details in `engine/README.md`):

- **All 138 filter quests**, read from the registry dump, for **all 48 cities in one pass**. The CLI
  `sc-open-quests-engine count` writes `docs/data/snapshots/<asOfDate>.json` and `docs/data/quests.json`
  per DATA-FORMAT.md. Custom (51) and note (1) quests are `unsupported`.
- **Settable clock, one patch.** `util/ktx/Instant.kt`'s `systemTimeNow()` reads a settable clock;
  every other wall-clock read in the vendored code goes through it. `sync-sc.ps1` applies it by exact
  line match and records it in `SC-VERSION.txt`. Age filters now run at the extract's replication
  timestamp, so a rerun on another day gives the same bytes (checked).
- **agedOnly** in the same pass: each match of an age quest is re-checked on the same thread with the
  clock at 1900. Toronto, 2026-07-16: 4,256 of 937,458 open quests match only because of time.
- **Country gating** per city as SC's `isInAny`; checked against SC's own `boundaries.ser`, which gives
  Ontario positions both `CA-ON` and `CA`. 11 filter quests are off in every Ontario city.
- **Quest positions from SC's own code.** `ElementGeometryCreator` and its maths are vendored unchanged
  (a stub enum stands in for osmfeatures' `GeometryType`): polygon centroid for areas, half-length point
  for lines, multipolygon ring assembly, member ways only. The 776 relations without a spike centre are
  now 1,360 relations without SC geometry: node-only relations and the like, which get no quest in the
  app either.
- **Denominators**: tagged nodes and ways in the city, and `highwayKm` (road classes motorway…service plus
  links, SC's spherical length).
- **Regression**: with the clock at 2026-10-11 the 12 spike quests in Toronto match the spike exactly
  except AddWayLit (117,651 vs 117,654). Centre changes move very few elements across a city boundary.
- **Speed**: about 20 s wall for Ontario on 24 threads, peak heap ~10.5 GB.

Known gaps:

- Notes are not modelled (the app hides a quest on an open note's position). (Since done: see "Notes".)
- Relation positions assume every member way is present; the app uses what it has downloaded.
- Country gating is per city, not per position; fine while every city is inside CA-ON.
- Custom quests (51) are not counted yet. (Since done: see the sections below.)

## Custom quests, first batch (2026-10-12)

- **Port, don't vendor; check against SC itself.** Custom quests sit in SC's androidMain beside their
  forms. The 9 whose applicability depends only on the element's tags are transcribed into
  `engine/src/main/kotlin/openquests/custom/`, each upstream file pinned by sha256 in
  `engine/PORTED-QUESTS.txt` (sync-sc.ps1 fails when one changes). Their commonMain helpers are vendored
  unchanged. SC's real classes, run on its unit-test classpath (`tools/sc-harness` CheckCustomQuests),
  are the oracle: on all 1.6M tagged Toronto elements of 2026-10-11 the port and SC agree on every one
  of 40,594 quests. So they are `supported`, not `approximated`.
- **The bucket was chosen mechanically:** a custom quest qualifies when `isApplicableTo` never returns
  null and needs no feature dictionary or country info. Next: the 6 that need SC's feature dictionary
  (osmfeatures has a JVM artifact and SC ships its presets), then the ~36 that need surrounding data.
- **Feature-dictionary quests (same day):** CheckShopExistence, CheckOpeningHoursSigned and AddPlaceName
  call `getFeature`. The engine builds SC's own: osmfeatures 8.0.0 (JVM build) over SC's preset files,
  in the JVM locale, pinned to en-CA like the time zone. Oracle again exact: 55,271 Toronto quests for
  all 12 ports. The app's locale is a knob like the resurvey multiplier, but it only decides whether a
  feature has a name; en-CA is the assumption for every city.
- **New quests show as a break, not a jump.** Only the newest snapshot (2026-10-11) was recounted; older
  ones keep `null` for the new quests. The site marks where the set of counted quests changes on the
  totals chart, and the "since last snapshot" tile compares the same quest types on both dates.

## Area quests (2026-10-12, decided while the owner was away)

- **ignoreRelation**: the app drops route (except ferry), boundary, waterway and similar relations on
  download, so both passes skip them (9,835 in Ontario). It changed none of the 150 earlier counts.
- **36 more custom quests**, the ones that need the surrounding map data, are counted. Only AddHousenumber,
  AddCycleway and AddRoofShape remain: they need SC's country metadata (`CountryInfo` from the
  `country_metadata` files plus the boundaries), the next step.
- **Generated ports.** `engine/port_area_quests.py` copies each quest file and drops only the UI and answer
  members; output and pins as for the hand ports. Generated, so a version bump is a rerun, not a rewrite.
- **The unit is the app's download tile (z16), not the city.** The app runs `getApplicableElements` on the
  data of one download; a whole city as one map data is a model of nobody's phone, and SC's quests are not
  written for it (AddMaxHeight is quadratic in roads x bridges and took over ten minutes on Toronto). Per
  tile, the counts match the app's behaviour after a one-tile download. Toronto per tile vs. per city:
  equal or within 0.1% for most quests, but 15-30% lower per tile for the quests that look for a large
  containing polygon (AddIsAmenityIndoor, AddLevel, AddLevelThing). **Open for the owner:** keep the
  smallest download (z16, now), or model a bigger one (z15, or a tile with its 8 neighbours).
- **Oracle again**: city mode on Guelph, Kingston, Barrie and Toronto (147,956 quests) gives identical sets
  with SC's own classes. It found one real bug: a quest returning an element twice was counted twice.
- Cost: the run goes from about 25 s to about 2 minutes and needs a 24 GB heap. Fine for a daily job.

## Country-metadata quests (2026-10-12)

- **All 51 custom quests are now counted.** The last three are AddHousenumber, AddCycleway and
  AddRoofShape. They take `getCountryInfoByLocation`, and the engine answers it as the app does:
  - SC's countryboundaries data gives the position's region ids;
  - SC's own `CountryInfos`, vendored unchanged with a `Res.readBytesOrNull` stub, merges `CA-ON.yml`,
    `CA.yml` and `default.yml`.

  `port_area_quests.py` maps the parameter to `ScCountryInfos`, as it maps `getFeature` to `ScFeatures`.
- **Per position, not per city.** The boundaries are cheap (527 KB) and this is the app's own lookup, so it
  is not modelled on the cities' `countryCodes` the way the quest gating is.
- **Oracle**: the harness registry now gets the real lookup instead of a mock. City mode on Guelph,
  Kingston, Barrie and Toronto gives identical sets for the three quests (502,915 quests).
- **AddHousenumber is the fourth quest the tile unit lowers.** In Toronto it gives 11,658 per z16 tile and
  12,541 per city (-7%). The cause is SC's own rule: a building must lie completely inside the downloaded
  bbox. The owner's open question about the unit size (z16 now, or bigger) covers it too.
- AddRoofShape is default-disabled in the app and very large: 365k in Toronto, since roofs are "not usually
  flat" in Canada. It is out of the headline totals like the other default-disabled quests.

## Area unit: the whole city (2026-10-12)

- **The owner chose the whole city over the z16 tile.** Area quests now run on one map data per city:
  the city's bbox padded by 1 km. That is what the app shows after downloading the whole city, and the
  counts no longer depend on where tile edges fall. Per tile undercounted the quests about a containing
  polygon or a crossing: over the 48 cities, AddHousenumber +9.6%, AddIsAmenityIndoor +59%, AddLevel +10%,
  AddMaxHeight +8% per city (table in engine/README.md). `--area-unit tiles` keeps the old unit.
- **Fast twins.** SC's code is written for small downloads. On a whole city, three quests compare
  everything with everything: AddMaxHeight took 231 s on Mississauga (a run of all cities did not finish in 30 minutes),
  AddIsAmenityIndoor 306 s on Ottawa. `openquests/fast/` holds a copy of each with one change that skips
  only work SC throws away. Toronto's area pass is now 43 s, and the whole run 216 s (was about 115 s per
  tile).
- **Exactness.** Toronto per city equals the oracle (SC's own classes) for every quest. A verify mode
  runs each port next to its twin on every city and fails on a difference. A test fails when SC's file
  moves away from the version a twin copies.
- **History.** Only 2026-10-11 holds area quests, so it was recounted and no chart has a break. Snapshots
  now carry `areaUnit`.

## Monthly history from the planet history file (2026-10-12)

- **Source.** Geofabrik keeps no old dailies. The planet full-history file (`history-261005`, 163 GB) was
  clipped once to Geofabrik's `ontario.poly` (`osmium extract --with-history -s complete_ways`, 50 minutes,
  2.0 GB) into `~/Code/.osm-data/ontario-history/`. `tools/backfill_history.py` cuts one snapshot per
  month with `osmium time-filter` at the 1st, 12:00 UTC, and writes that instant as the file's
  `osmosis_replication_timestamp`, so the engine's clock (age filters) is the month, as for a daily.
- **Today's rules on past data.** Every month is counted with the current registry (v63.4) and engine.
  The series answers "what would this app version have shown then". It does not show what the app of
  that time showed: many quest types did not exist, and SC's resurvey intervals changed.
- **Check: a slice equals a Geofabrik extract.** Slicing at the 2026-08-22 extract's replication time
  and counting both with the same engine gave the same snapshot: 7,506,807 open, every quest, every city,
  every denominator. So the monthly points and the dailies sit on one line without a seam. The slice
  lacks some relation members across the Ontario border (`complete_ways` cannot complete relations in a
  history file), which does not reach any count.
- Months are counted into `data/backfill/` (gitignored), reviewed, then merged into `docs/data/<region>/snapshots/`.

## Notes (2026-10-12, decided while the owner was away)

- **Source: the planet notes dump, not the Notes API.** The API knows only today. The daily dump
  (`planet-notes-YYMMDD.osn.bz2`, 410 MB) holds every note with every comment and its timestamp, so the
  notes open at any asOf can be rebuilt: dailies and the monthly backfill take the same code path.
  `osm-extracts fetch notes` downloads it into the shared store (newest 2 kept, each dump supersedes the
  last); `tools/clip_notes.py` cuts the Ontario bounding box into `data/notes/` once per dump (about 3
  minutes, 88,128 notes, 35 MB).
- **Two effects, both SC's own logic.** Every open note hides the quests at its position, truncated to
  6 decimals (`OsmQuestController`); and a note is a note quest by SC's own filter (`OsmNoteQuestController`,
  ported verbatim and pinned) for a user who wrote none of the notes, with "show all notes" off, the app's
  default: a question mark in the first comment (SC's list includes `;`) or `#surveyme` in any comment.
  `OsmNoteQuestType` is now `supported` and in the headline totals.
- **Size of it.** 2026-10-10: 3,624 notes open in the clip's box (it reaches into the US), 763 of them note
  quests, 189 inside the 48 cities (Toronto 71); 322 of 7,588,287 quests hidden (AddWheelchairAccessBusiness 30, AddOpeningHours 26, CheckShopExistence 23...;
  Toronto 120, Ottawa 95). Checked independently: the run with notes equals the run without minus exactly
  the matches whose truncated position is an open note's.
- **A dump must reach the extract.** The dump of day D is made about 05:00 UTC and ends there; Geofabrik's
  extract of day D is stamped about 20:20 UTC. So day D is counted with the dump of D+1, and `run.py`
  waits a run rather than count without notes. `update` now goes over every stored extract, so a snapshot
  made before its dump existed is recounted once it does.
- **History.** Snapshots record the dump in `notes`; history meta carries `notes: true` and the site marks
  the date notes start (or stop) as a break. Extracts no longer in the store (2026-07-16, 2026-10-02) keep
  their counts without notes; the monthly backfill passes the newest clip too. Recounting 2026-08-22 and
  2026-10-10 with notes also brought them the 49 custom quests they lacked.

## Resurvey settings, "show all notes" and tile grids (2026-10-13)

- **Asked for so that the history is counted once.** Before the final backfill, the owner chose three
  things to store that would otherwise need another full reprocess: the app's other resurvey settings,
  the note quest with "show all notes", and positions for heatmaps.
- **Resurvey ×0.5 and ×2** for every age quest (`open05`/`aged05`, `open2`/`aged2`), in the same pass:
  a second patch (`multiplier`) makes SC's global `RelativeDate.MULTIPLIER` thread-local, as the clock
  patch did for "today". Exact: whole runs at ×2 and ×0.5 equal the in-pass numbers for all 8,448 city ×
  quest pairs (2026-10-10). Ontario's 48 cities: 7,588,154 open at ×1, 7,777,301 at ×0.5, 7,516,201 at
  ×2. Toronto AddBusStopShelter: 6,093 / 3,732 / 1,674. Run time unchanged (about 266 s).
- **"Show all notes"**: 822 note quests instead of 189 (Toronto 274 instead of 71).
- **Tile grids**: counted quests per z14 tile (about 2.2 × 1.6 km) per quest, `data/grid/`, about 0.5 MB
  gzipped per snapshot, not committed. The sums equal `open` for every quest. Publishing (all of it, or
  newest plus yearly) is still open, with the heatmap page.
- History files and the site do not show any of it yet; `run.py history` can add them from the snapshots
  without a recount.

## Site look: StreetComplete's own (2026-10-13)

- **Colours from the app's theme** (`ui/theme/Color.kt`): indigo `#4141ba` for the header, the hero tile
  and "needs mapping"; orange `#D14000` (`#ff6600` dark) for "aged"; traffic-sign green and red for
  changes. Rounded white cards as in the app, and its white map pin as the motif.
- **Quest icons and titles.** `tools/sc_assets.py <sc-checkout>` follows each quest class's
  `override val icon` and `override val title` to `res/graphics/quest/*.svg` and the English
  `strings.xml`, writing `docs/icons/` (index.json, the SVGs, SC's graphics `authors.txt`). The table and
  charts name a quest by the question the app asks ("Does this bench have a backrest?"), class name below.
  Icons are CC-BY-SA 4.0, credited in the footer. Rerun on every SC version bump.
- **Releases on the timeline.** `tools/sc_releases.py` writes the stable GitHub releases to
  `docs/data/sc-releases.json`; run it by hand after a release (not in the daily run, to keep that free of
  another network dependency). Pins sit in a strip above each chart: over a long range only major
  versions, each labelled where its label fits and a dot otherwise; hovering one names it and its date.
  They are context only: every count uses the pinned version's quests whatever the date, which the chart
  says under the legend. They are kept apart from the break lines, which mark changes in *this site's*
  counting.
- Both files are optional; without them the site falls back to class names and hides the releases toggle.

## Selection, pins and the link (2026-10-21)

- **The reader picks the quests that count.** Every quest in the table has a tick; the totals, the tiles
  and the summary chart sum the ticked ones. The default is the app's own: every quest it turns on by
  default, so the off-by-default ones sit in the table unticked and muted rather than behind a checkbox.
  The header tick ticks or unticks every row the search box leaves ("bench", tick), and "App defaults"
  resets. The compare view still ranks by the app-default total, which `cities.json` carries
  precomputed; it says so.
- **Pins are the per-quest charts.** The pin button beside a quest adds its own chart above the table,
  up to six, in the app's pin shape; the old tick-to-chart is gone.
- **The query string reproduces the view**, hash-free since this date: `city`, `view=compare`,
  `pin=A,B`, `cq` (compare quest), `rel=0`, and the selection as a base plus a diff: `base=app` (left
  out), `none` or `all`, with `on=A,B` ticked on top and `off=C,D` unticked from it. The site writes the
  base whose diff names the fewest quests, in registry order, so one selection gives one link. Quest
  class names are the key because they outlive releases: a name the site no longer knows is dropped,
  and a new quest follows the base, so a link made under v63 still opens under v64 and means what it
  said. Old `#city=…&q=…` links are read once (`q` were the charted quests, now pins) and rewritten.
  `?data=` is carried through.

## Regions: Germany's city-states beside Ontario (2026-10-13)

- **Why.** Ontario's totals barely move: few people solve quests there. The owner wanted cities where
  quests are being closed, small enough to be cheap. Germany is StreetComplete's largest community, and
  its three city-states are Geofabrik extracts of their own (Berlin 95 MB, Hamburg 51 MB, Bremen 20 MB),
  so each extract is the city: Berlin, Hamburg, and in the Bremen extract the cities Bremen and
  Bremerhaven.
- **A region is an extract.** `config/regions.json` lists them; a city names its region. The engine runs
  once per region, on that region's cities only, into `docs/data/<region>/`; `run.py history` merges the
  regions. One run is one time zone (SC's date filters read the JVM's), so a region's cities share its
  zone, and `run.py` sets it with `JAVA_OPTS=-Duser.timezone=…`. Notes and the planet history are clipped
  per region, with Geofabrik's `.poly`.
- **Country metadata.** SC v63.4 ships `DE.yml` and no `DE-*` file, and its boundaries give German
  positions only `DE`, so the German cities' `countryCodes` are `["DE"]`. Bundling `DE.yml` matters:
  without it a Berlin position reads `default.yml`, where cycle lanes are never advisory.
- **Approximations for the German cities.** The feature presets stay `en-CA` (`getFeature()` matches by
  tags; only names differ from a German phone). `landAreaKm2` is the OSM boundary's area, water
  included, as for Ontario: Hamburg's 980.9 km² against the official 755 km² is the Neuwerk exclave's
  boundary running out over the Wadden Sea mudflats. Populations are Destatis's, 31.12.2025.

## Repin to StreetComplete v64.0 (2026-10-21)

- **The operation has a name: repin.** Everything the engine counts with is pinned to one SC tag (the
  vendored source, the ports, the registry dump, icons, release pins); moving them all is a repin, the
  routine is [REPIN.md](REPIN.md). The scheduled update now ends with `run.py check-release`: it
  refreshes `docs/data/sc-releases.json` and opens the GitHub issue "Repin to StreetComplete vX.Y"
  once when a stable release is newer than `engine/SC-VERSION.txt`. It is the one network dependency
  the daily run has besides the extracts, and it cannot fail the run: the data is published first, and
  any error in it is logged and ignored.
- **What v64.0 changed for the counts.** 193 quest types (was 190): added AddDoctorType,
  AddVendingMachineType, AddGeneralAccess (replaces AddPlaygroundAccess and AddTowerAccess),
  AddChargingStationSocket (custom: a charging station without mapped charge points),
  AddParkingCharge, AddMotorcycleParkingSurface, AddChargingStationMotorcar and AddLockable (the two
  replace AddChargingStationCapacity and AddChargingStationBicycleCapacity); removed
  AddProhibitedForPedestrians. 57 filter quests and three hand-ported ones (AddOpeningHours,
  CheckOpeningHoursSigned, AddPlaceName) now take relations; CheckShopExistence no longer requires a
  name (a nameless shop whose preset has a name counts, so it rises); AddIsAmenityIndoor asks for
  bicycle repair stations too. A removed quest leaves the table (quests.json is the newest registry)
  while its series stays in the history files.
- **What v64.0 changed for the engine.** SC became multiplatform: every quest moved from androidMain
  to commonMain, with a Compose form instead of an Android one, so sync-sc.ps1 and the port generator
  read commonMain, the generator drops Compose imports and annotations, and a `Foo.*` import of a
  quest package stays only when the kept code names Foo. SC started caching a date filter's threshold
  (`by lazy`); that would freeze the engine's movable clock and resurvey multiplier after the first
  evaluation, so a third recorded patch, `nolazy`, makes both getters again. New stubs: Compose's
  `LocaleList` (the phone's locale list is the JVM's default locale, en-CA, so
  `getLanguagesForFeatureDictionary()` gives en-CA, en, null), `DrawableResource` and
  `Res.allDrawableResources` (osm/Feature.kt grew an icon lookup), `ApplicationConstants`
  (`MAX_OSM_TAG_VALUE_LENGTH`; `Element` now requires every tag key and value to be at most 255
  characters, which OSM's API guarantees), `readYamlOrNull`. SC's harness needs a JDK 25 since v64
  (Gradle downloads it: tools/sc-harness/README.md).
- **Checked.** The oracle (SC's own classes on the same map data) gives identical sets for all 52
  custom quests on Guelph (33,389 quests) and, for the first time, on a German city: Bremerhaven
  (20,404; AddCycleway, AddHousenumber and AddRoofShape read DE.yml there). The three fast twins
  match their ports on both. The engine's unit tests pass; TorontoRegressionTest stays on v63.4.json
  on purpose (it regresses the vendored filter and geometry code, not the quest set).
- **Where the break is.** After a repin `run.py count` (also inside `update`'s backfill) recounts
  the newest extract of each region with the new registry and leaves the older ones in the store
  alone, so by default the first v64 snapshot is the newest extract at merge time and the totals chart
  marks the change of the counted set there ("+8 types 64.0"), as it did for the custom quests. **For
  v64.0 there is no such break:** the Canada backfill of the same night (next section) recounted every
  published Ontario and German snapshot with v64.0 too, so every series carries one registry and the
  site's break list, which compares consecutive snapshots, has nothing to mark. The branch carried no
  data commit on purpose: the daily "data" commits would conflict with it in the generated history
  files; the first run from main after the merge made it.
- **Merging `sc-v64` into main** (written while another session had uncommitted province work in
  main): `engine/SC-VERSION.txt` is generated, never hand-merged; after the merge rerun
  `engine/sync-sc.ps1 -ScPath <Temp/sc-v64.0> -Tag v64.0` with whatever the other side added to
  `$resources` (its `CA-*.yml` must exist in the v64 checkout). `sync-sc.ps1`, `engine/README.md`,
  `CountriesTest.kt` and `CountryInfoQuestsTest.kt` hand-merge, both sides are additive. Then, from
  main and before the next 13:15: `engine/gradlew installDist` and `test` (the first build downloads
  Kotlin 2.4.20; do not leave that to the scheduler), `python run.py count`, `history`, and commit the
  data. `tools/sc_assets.py` ran already (the icons commit). Ontario's count went from 196 s to
  245 s: CheckShopExistence now asks the feature dictionary for every nameless place before its age
  filter, as SC does. `gh` under Task Scheduler is unproven; a failure shows as
  "check-release failed (ignored)" in `logs/scheduler.log`.

## Regions: the rest of Canada (2026-10-21)

- **Why and what.** The owner asked for the whole of Canada. The rule is one that holds everywhere:
  **every municipality of 50,000 or more in the 2021 census** (Wikipedia's list of the 100 largest,
  parsed from the wikitext). 63 cities joined: 58 in eight new regions, and the five Ontario ones the
  farmland list lacked (Clarington, Caledon, Norfolk County, Halton Hills, Aurora); the 11 Ontario cities
  under 50k stay, their history exists. The territories are out: no municipality clears the bar, and
  Nunavut's extract is 1.4 GB for Iqaluit's 7,000 people.
- **A province is a region.** Geofabrik cuts Canada by province, so `config/regions.json` has one entry
  and one `.poly` per province, with its time zone (Quebec counts in America/Toronto, Saskatchewan in
  America/Regina, Newfoundland in America/St_Johns). `~/Code/osm-extracts` knows the eight URLs. The site
  groups the city list by region group, so every province is its own group, Ontario as before.
- **Relations.** Wikidata's P402 (OSM relation id) for each article; 37 of 42 Ontario rows resolved to a
  relation already in config, which checks the method. Five had no P402 (Levis, Repentigny, Saint-Jerome,
  Saint-Hyacinthe, Halton Hills) and came from Nominatim. `tools/add_city.py` fetched each boundary and
  checked it against the province's `.poly`. Populations are StatCan 2021 (`populationSource`); North
  Vancouver is two cities, the city (`north-vancouver`) and the district (`north-vancouver-district`).
- **Country metadata.** SC ships a `CA-<province>.yml` for all 13 provinces and territories, and its
  boundaries give a Montreal position `CA-QC`, `CA`, so `sync-sc.ps1` now bundles all 13 (it had CA-ON
  only); the engine's tests cover Montreal (`officialLanguages: [fr]`, `hasBicycleBoulevard`) and
  Vancouver, and accept `CA-<province>` and `CA` for every city. Montreal's quest gating equals
  Toronto's: none of the 14 quests the app withholds in Ontario distinguishes provinces. German counts
  did not move by a single quest from bundling the files.
- **Cost, measured** (v63.4 engine, 40 GB heap, 24 threads): Ontario with 53 cities 305 s and a 41 GB
  peak (was 196 s, 33 GB with 48; the four large rural municipalities are most of it), Quebec 19 cities
  109 s / 29 GB, British Columbia 20 cities 90 s / 24 GB, Alberta 10 cities 63 s / 23 GB, the five
  small provinces 10 to 22 s each. A full count of the twelve regions is about 13 minutes; the eight
  new extracts are 3.4 GB a day (about 10 minutes to download here) and about 48 GB in the store at the
  14-day retention. The planet history was clipped to all eight provinces in one osmium pass (1 h 4 min;
  Quebec 1.6 GB, British Columbia 1.7 GB, the rest 0.1 to 0.3 GB each). `backfill_history.py`'s quiet
  window around the 13:15 run is now 12:55 to 13:50.
- **History.** The overnight job (`.scratch/canada-backfill.sh`) counts the eight provinces' months
  2017-01 to 2026-10 and recounts Ontario's and Germany's published snapshots, all with v64.0 (merged the
  same evening), so one registry holds everywhere and the chart needs no "+8 types" break. Ontario
  dailies whose extract is gone and that lie after the history file's end (2026-10-06) keep their 48-city
  counts; the five new Ontario cities have monthly points to 2026-10-01 and dailies from 2026-10-07.


## Planet coverage: what was measured (2026-10-24)

The owner asked for planet coverage. Before building, four checks; the owner's choices are still open
(HANDOFF.md, "Planet coverage").

- **Clipping keeps the counts exact.** Ontario clipped to its cities' bboxes padded by 2 km
  (`osmium extract -s smart`, 46 s, 985 MB to 339 MB, `--output-header=osmosis_replication_timestamp=...`
  or the engine refuses the file) gives the same snapshot, grid and quests.json as the published
  2026-10-23. One relation more lands "in some city" (a route or boundary losing far members); no count
  moves. A production clip should keep `-S types=multipolygon,boundary,route` (not yet run).
- **Heap follows the biggest city, not the extract.** The 34 GB peaks are a lazy collector under
  `-Xmx40g`. Ontario runs in 12-16 GB, clipped or not; Berlin's 7.9M nodes need 4-8 GB, all of it
  the whole-city area pass. Time is the same story: about 150 s of Ontario's 188 s is the area pass.
  So the planet is not a memory problem once it is clipped to city envelopes; a Tokyo or a Chongqing
  is, and needs an area cap or a split.
- **Engine limits for arbitrary countries** (file:line in the session report, summarised):
  at most 64 cities per run (a 64-bit city mask, AreaPass.kt); one time zone and one output folder per
  run (Main.kt, run.py), so a region cannot be split into two runs on one extract; only 16 of SC's
  country_metadata files are bundled, and a missing one falls back to default.yml silently;
  `add_city.py` needs country codes and zone typed by hand and its `slug()` drops non-ASCII names;
  notes are clipped once per region (46 s each, the whole dump each time); osm-extracts knows 12 URLs
  and has no replication diffs. Already global: SC's boundaries.ser, quest gating, geometry, the grid.
- **Cities from Wikidata** (P1082 population, P402 relation; `.scratch/world-cities/`):

  | population at least | settlements and municipalities | with an OSM relation | of those, not province-sized |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1M | 732 | 536 | 255 |
  | 500k | 1,313 | 898 | 594 |
  | 250k | 2,482 | 1,602 | 1,287 |
  | 100k | 6,001 | 3,666 | 3,342 |

  P402 is missing for nearly all of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Egypt, and half of Russia and China;
  where OSM has the boundary it often links the parent province item instead (Istanbul, Izmir, Tokyo).
  "Province-sized" is mostly China's prefecture-level cities (Chongqing 82,403 km²), Turkey's
  metropolitan provinces and Tokyo-to. Wikidata areas and populations are often wrong by a factor.
- **Publishing breaks first, and already at today's size.** GitHub Pages publishes at most 1 GB.
  `docs/` holds 334 MB, 316 MB of it the 1,485 snapshot files kept forever, growing 2.5 MB a day: the
  cap is about 9 months away with no new city. A snapshot is 21.8 KB per city, history 1.2 KB per city
  per date, and the compare view downloads every region's snapshot. At 1,000 cities the monthly history
  alone is 2.6 GB. Fix, needed regardless of the planet: publish only the newest snapshot per region
  (archive outside `docs/`), a small per-quest file for compare, and at a few thousand cities daily data
  out of git (R2 or release assets).
- **Disk.** 151 GB free on C:, with the 163 GB planet history file in the store. A planet pbf is about
  85 GB more.

## Planet coverage: the owner's direction (2026-10-24)

- **Players come first.** The site is for StreetComplete players asking "how is my place doing?", not
  for planet totals per quest type.
- **Every place on Earth gets a name, but only requested places get counted.** A named breakdown of
  the whole world exists up front; stats are counted for a place only when its community asks for it.
  Whether land outside any city (rural roads) counts is still being debated.
- **Wandrer.earth is the model.** Its nested named regions (country down to neighbourhood) are the
  inspiration, and possibly the data source for the breakdown. Whether its regions can be reused, and
  under what licence, is for the session that explores the breakdown.
- **Cities stay as they are for now:** the population bar of today. Inside a city, counts go down to
  neighbourhoods, Wandrer-style.
- **History and cadence (asked in the measuring session):** monthly history since 2017 for every place
  that gets counted, as for Canada and Germany, cut from the planet history file; then weekly counts from
  one planet file, clipped to the counted places' envelopes in one pass. Canada and Germany stay daily.
  Disk is set aside for later; the owner will solve it.

## Places: naming the world, counting on request (proposal, 2026-10-24)

Proposal from the breakdown session; nothing built. Sources are in the session's two research reports
(Wandrer.earth; world boundary datasets), the URLs repeated here where a choice rests on them.

- **Wandrer cannot be the data source; it is the model.** No API, no export, region pages behind a
  login, "All Rights Reserved" (wandrer.earth/terms). Its regions are OSM boundaries plus neighbourhoods
  patched in one city at a time from 38 municipal open-data sources, each credited on its terms page, and
  added when a user emails the source (wandrer.earth/faq). It rebuilds from one planet file about monthly.
  Copy that: OSM as the backbone, neighbourhoods patched per request from open data, a data-licences
  page, requests that bring their source.
- **Names from Overture Maps `divisions`.** ODbL like our output; one world hierarchy with
  `parent_division_id`, normalised `subtype` (country, region, county, localadmin, locality, borough,
  macrohood, neighborhood, microhood), local names, wikidata, monthly releases (latest 2026-10-21.0),
  6.4 GB for the world, downloadable per bbox (docs.overturemaps.org/guides/divisions). Each feature
  names its OSM source (`sources[].record_id` such as `r166560@15`, plus bridge files). Raw OSM
  `admin_level` cannot be the hierarchy: its meaning changes per country. Who's On First (sporadic, 42 GB,
  CC-BY parts), geoBoundaries (no parents, mixed licences) and GADM (no redistribution) are out.
- **Two layers, two ids.** The *name layer* is every Overture division: id, name, parent, subtype, bbox,
  centroid, OSM relation. No polygons, nothing counted. The *count layer* is the places someone asked
  for, counted on OSM geometry by relation id as `add_city.py` does today, so the boundary and the counts
  come from the same data. The public id is a readable path (`ca/on/toronto/the-annex`, Unicode-safe),
  mapped to the GERS id; GERS ids survive Overture's conflation but subtypes move with OSM tagging
  (Czechia and Slovakia, 2026-06 release), so a monthly diff flags places whose subtype or parent moved.
- **Three kinds of counted place.**
  - *Run place*: today's city. Its own map data, so the area quests stay exact (DESIGN.md, "Area unit").
  - *Sub-place*: a neighbourhood or borough inside a run place. Counted from quest positions inside
    its polygon, in the run place's pass: the engine already counts one element towards several
    overlapping places (`Engine.kt` `offer`, the `cityIdx` loop), so a sub-place is one more polygon in
    the index with no map data of its own. Its numbers are the city's numbers split by position, which is
    what a player there sees. Lifting the 64-place mask (taken by the measuring session) is the one
    engine prerequisite.
  - *Roll-up*: a region or country. Only the sum of its counted children, labelled "N of M places
    counted". Never a number that looks like full coverage.
- **Land outside cities** then has an answer that costs nothing to decide later: it is a county or
  localadmin in the name layer, and counting it means requesting it as a run place. Neighbourhoods
  never cover what their city does not, and children are not promised to add up to the parent
  (OSM neighbourhood polygons overlap and leave gaps).
- **What it costs before anyone asks.** A name shard per country, loaded when the reader opens that
  country, and per city for its neighbourhoods. Size unmeasured; with the Pages cap (DESIGN.md,
  "Planet coverage: what was measured") it must stay well under 100 MB for the world or live outside
  `docs/` like the archive.
- **The request.** The site's search finds any place. An uncounted place shows its hierarchy and an
  "Ask for this place" link: a GitHub issue form, prefilled with the place id, where a 👍 is a vote and
  a reply can name an open neighbourhood source. Adding a requested place stays a reviewed commit.
- **Where Overture is thin.** Neighbourhoods are spotty below county (Overture's own docs); some
  features come from geoBoundaries with no OSM relation, and those count on Overture's polygon or not at
  all. Fill neighbourhoods from OSM (`admin_level` 9-11, `place=suburb|quarter|neighbourhood` areas,
  `boundary=place`) attached under the Overture parent by containment, then municipal open data per
  request (Toronto's 158 neighbourhoods are OGL-Toronto, which Wandrer already uses).
- **Disputed areas** (Kashmir, Crimea, ...): Overture carries perspectives; pick one policy before the
  first such country.

**The owner's answers (2026-10-24, late evening):** names from Overture `divisions`, counting on OSM
geometry, as proposed. Neighbourhoods from **OSM only**: where neither OSM nor Overture has one, the
city has none; no municipal open data, so no per-source licence checks. Requests through a **GitHub
issue form** (players without an account cannot ask; accepted). The spike below runs that night.

**Next, a spike before any building:** pull Overture divisions for Canada and Germany with DuckDB (not
installed; `pip install duckdb` in the .venv) and measure: features per subtype, the share with an OSM
relation, whether the 115 counted cities are found by relation id, neighbourhoods inside Toronto and
Berlin, and the size of a name shard per country, extrapolated to the world.

## Publish format: newest snapshot only (2026-10-24)

- **What the site fetches** (read off `app.js`): `cities.json`, `quests.json`, `sc-releases.json`,
  `icons/index.json`, `history/<city>.json`, and, in the compare view with a quest picked, every
  region's newest snapshot (each city's `asOfDate`). No view and no link reads an older dated snapshot:
  the query string has no date, and the charts read the history files.
- **The archive leaves `docs/`.** The engine writes `data/archive/<region>/snapshots/<asOfDate>.json`
  and its `quests.json` (gitignored; `--out data/archive/<region>`, no engine change), and
  `run.py history` reads the archive. `docs/data/<region>/snapshots/` keeps the region's newest
  snapshot only, a byte copy: 12 files, 2.5 MB. It stays in git, so git history holds each day's
  published newest; months merged later by `backfill_history.py` are in the archive only.
- **Compare reads one small file per quest**, `docs/data/compare/<quest>.json`: each city's open count
  in its newest snapshot, 184 files of about 1.75 KB. Picking a quest fetches 1.75 KB instead of
  12 snapshots (2.5 MB). Checked equal to the old lookup for all 22,195 city × quest pairs.
- **Sizes.** `docs/` went from 1,795 files, 332.7 MB, to 506 files, 19.3 MB (history 15.0 MB). It now
  grows by the history files only, about 0.1 MB a day at 115 cities instead of 2.5 MB. The archive is
  317 MB on disk and grows as `docs/` used to.
- **History did not move.** Rebuilt from the archive, all 115 history files, `cities.json` and
  `quests.json` are byte-identical to the ones built from `docs/data`.
- **Migration is a step, not a commit.** `run.py migrate-archive` moves any snapshot still in
  `docs/data/<region>/snapshots/` (and the engine's old `docs/data/<region>/quests.json`) into the
  archive; `count` and `history` run it first, so the scheduled `update` migrates by itself and its
  `git add docs/data` stages the 1,473 deletions. Idempotent; a file that differs from the archive's
  copy is left in place and logged.
- **A lost archive cannot shrink the site.** `history` refuses to run when the archive lacks a date
  that the published `cities.json` has (a fresh clone, a deleted `data/`), instead of rebuilding a
  shorter history. The snapshots up to 2026-10-24 can be restored from git history; of later ones git
  has only each day's published newest, so the archive is the one copy of the rest (not backed up).
