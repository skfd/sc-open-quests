# Design

Status: dos and don'ts drawn from the prior-art survey, discussed 2026-10-11. Decisions below are agreed.

## The one idea

Count what the app would show. Each number on the site should be "how many quests of type T a StreetComplete
user standing in city C would see, with default settings, on app version V". Each knob that moves that number
is recorded alongside it.

## Do

- **Take filters from the app's build, not from reading its source.**
  - 21 filter strings splice in Kotlin constants, so a regex over the source gets them wrong.
  - Run SC's own registry, either through a small JVM harness next to `PrintQuestFiltersAsOverpassQL` that
    prints each resolved `elementFilter` in SC syntax, or by evaluating with SC's Kotlin directly.
  - Pin the SC release tag (v63.4 today) and store it on every snapshot.
- **Stamp each snapshot with the three knobs:**
  - SC version.
  - Resurvey multiplier: the app's user setting of 0.5, 1 or 2 (proposed default 1).
  - Whether the 34 default-disabled quests are counted.
- **Classify every quest from the code, not by hand.**
  - The 138 `OsmFilterQuestType` (v63.4) start as *supported*.
  - The 51 custom quests start as *unsupported*.
  - A custom quest moves up to *approximated* or *supported* only when someone writes its logic and checks it
    against the app.
  - Show the class on the site.
- **Split the aging signal from the mapping signal by using the filter itself.**
  - The 48 quests whose filters use `older` can reopen with no edit at all.
  - For those, record the count from the plain tag test and the count that only exists because the element
    or check_date has aged, separately.
- **Apply country gating for Canada and Ontario** (`enabledInCountries`, 27 quests; codes include subdivisions such as CA-ON). Leaving it out
  overcounts.
- **Count by the quest's center point inside the real city polygon.** This matches the app (`OsmQuestController`
  creates a quest only if its center is inside the downloaded area) and avoids starsep's bounding-box
  overcount.
- **Take boundaries from `ontario-farmland`.** Toronto is relation 324211 at admin_level **6**; other cities
  are at 8. Configure cities by relation id, not by admin level.
- **Store denominators beside counts:** element count per quest's base selector, road km, land area from
  `areas.json`.
- **Read the extract from the shared store, don't download it.** `../osm-extracts` owns the Geofabrik
  download into `~/Code/.osm-data` (`OSM_DATA_DIR`). The run calls `osm_extracts.py fetch ontario`, then
  opens the dated file named by `ontario/latest.json` and records its name and sha256 with the snapshot.
- **Reuse the sibling plumbing:**
  - Skip the run when `latest.json`'s `source_last_modified` hasn't changed, so reruns change nothing.
  - One row per day, rewritten if run again the same day.
  - Static JSON under `docs/` served by Pages, published by `run.py update`.
- **Rely on extract timestamps.** Checked 2026-10-11: Geofabrik's public Ontario PBF keeps `version` and
  `timestamp` and strips `uid` and `changeset`. That covers what `older` needs.
- **Adding a city is a line of config.**

## Don't

- Don't hand-write Overpass queries, and don't take filters from the OSM wiki's Turbo links (#2072). They
  drift and some are wrong.
- Don't use ohsome as the engine. Its filter language can't express regex, numbers, dates or element age,
  and v1 dies 2026-11-30. At most, use it to backfill history for the plain key/value quests.
- Don't silently approximate. A quest counted with simplified logic says so on the page.
- Don't compare raw counts across cities on the default view; normalize first.
- Don't mix runs from different SC versions or settings in one line without marking the break.
- Don't treat open OSM notes as noise. The app hides a quest whose center sits exactly on an open note. This
  is minor, but note it as a known difference until we model it.
- Don't schedule at 12:00 or 12:30; the sibling trackers already use those slots.
- Don't stall on the 51 custom quests. Ship the filter quests first.

## Decisions (agreed 2026-10-11)

- **Engine: Kotlin on the JVM, using SC's own filter code.** No port of the grammar. SC is a pinned
  dependency (or source checkout at a release tag). The first task is a spike that confirms `commonMain`
  `ElementFilterExpression` runs on a plain JVM, reading the PBF with a JVM library (e.g. osm4j or
  GeoDesk). Python stays an option for glue only if it earns its place.
- **Headline counts use app defaults:** resurvey multiplier 1, default-disabled quests excluded from totals
  but still computed and stored, so the site can offer a toggle.
- **Hosting:** Windows Task Scheduler on the owner's machine plus static JSON in `docs/` on GitHub Pages,
  same as toronto-streets-osm. Run slot away from 12:00/12:30, e.g. 13:15.
- **Outreach: nobody yet.** Build the Toronto milestone, then contact starsep, the SC devs and jmizv with
  something to show.

## Spike result (2026-10-11)

- **The engine works without patches.** 26 SC v63.4 `commonMain` files are vendored byte-for-byte by
  `engine/sync-sc.ps1`, which records sha256s in `SC-VERSION.txt`. They compile on a plain JVM with Kotlin
  2.4.0 and kotlinx-datetime 0.8.0, the same versions SC uses.
- **PBF reading:** `osmpbf` protobuf classes with our own three-stage parallel decoder. One full Ontario pass
  takes about 9 s, with a 9–10 GB peak heap and about 132.6M nodes indexed.
- **Cross-checked against pyosmium:** AddBenchBackrest (2,931) and AddBusStopShelter (3,719, which uses
  `older`) matched exactly in the Toronto polygon.
- **Filters come from the build:** `tools/sc-harness` dumps all 190 quests to `data/quests/v63.4.json`, and
  all 138 filter strings re-parse.
- **Semantics to remember:**
  - Date filters use the system time zone. Pin `-Duser.timezone=America/Toronto`.
  - **"Today" must be the extract's replication timestamp, not the wall clock.** The spike used the
    wall-clock date, 2026-10-11, against a 2026-07-16 extract. That miscounts the 48 `older` quests, and a
    rerun of the same extract on another day would change the counts.
    - The vendored `util/ktx/Instant.kt` calls `Clock.System.now()` directly. That's the one place vendoring
      has to deviate: add a settable clock, and have `sync-sc.ps1` apply it as a recorded patch.
    - The same lesson as toronto-streets-osm: "date a row by its extract".
  - `tag older X` is also true when the *element* hasn't been edited since X, so element age counts as well
    as check dates.
- **Known approximations** still to replace (the first two are fixed in milestone 1, below):
  - Way centres are a plain average of their nodes, not SC's centroid or midpoint.
  - Relation centres ignore sub-relations; 776 Ontario relations got no centre.
  - Notes aren't modelled.
- **Licence:** the engine is a GPL-3.0 derivative, so this repo needs a GPL-compatible licence.

## Engine (milestone 1, 2026-10-11)

What changed since the spike (details in `engine/README.md`):

- **All 138 filter quests**, read from the registry dump, for **all 48 cities in one pass**. The CLI
  `sc-open-quests-engine count` writes `docs/data/snapshots/<asOfDate>.json` and `docs/data/quests.json`
  per DATA-FORMAT.md. Custom (51) and note (1) quests are `unsupported`.
- **Settable clock, one patch.** `util/ktx/Instant.kt`'s `systemTimeNow()` reads a settable clock;
  every other wall-clock read in the vendored code goes through it. `sync-sc.ps1` applies it by exact
  line match and records it in `SC-VERSION.txt`. Age filters now run at the extract's replication
  timestamp, so a rerun on another day gives the same bytes (checked).
- **agedOnly** in the same pass: each match of an age quest is re-checked on the same thread with the
  clock at 1900. Toronto, 2026-07-16: 4,256 of 937,458 open quests match only because of time.
- **Country gating** per city as SC's `isInAny`; checked against SC's own `boundaries.ser`, which gives
  Ontario positions both `CA-ON` and `CA`. 11 filter quests are off in every Ontario city.
- **Quest positions from SC's own code.** `ElementGeometryCreator` and its maths are vendored unchanged
  (a stub enum stands in for osmfeatures' `GeometryType`): polygon centroid for areas, half-length point
  for lines, multipolygon ring assembly, member ways only. The 776 relations without a spike centre are
  now 1,360 relations without SC geometry: node-only relations and the like, which get no quest in the
  app either.
- **Denominators**: tagged nodes and ways in the city, and `highwayKm` (road classes motorway…service plus
  links, SC's spherical length).
- **Regression**: with the clock at 2026-10-11 the 12 spike quests in Toronto match the spike exactly
  except AddWayLit (117,651 vs 117,654). Centre changes move very few elements across a city boundary.
- **Speed**: about 20 s wall for Ontario on 24 threads, peak heap ~10.5 GB.

Known gaps:

- Notes are not modelled (the app hides a quest on an open note's position).
- Relation positions assume every member way is present; the app uses what it has downloaded.
- Country gating is per city, not per position; fine while every city is inside CA-ON.
- Custom quests (51) are not counted yet.

## Custom quests, first batch (2026-10-12)

- **Port, don't vendor; check against SC itself.** Custom quests sit in SC's androidMain beside their
  forms. The 9 whose applicability depends only on the element's tags are transcribed into
  `engine/src/main/kotlin/openquests/custom/`, each upstream file pinned by sha256 in
  `engine/PORTED-QUESTS.txt` (sync-sc.ps1 fails when one changes). Their commonMain helpers are vendored
  unchanged. SC's real classes, run on its unit-test classpath (`tools/sc-harness` CheckCustomQuests),
  are the oracle: on all 1.6M tagged Toronto elements of 2026-10-11 the port and SC agree on every one
  of 40,594 quests. So they are `supported`, not `approximated`.
- **The bucket was chosen mechanically:** a custom quest qualifies when `isApplicableTo` never returns
  null and needs no feature dictionary or country info. Next: the 6 that need SC's feature dictionary
  (osmfeatures has a JVM artifact and SC ships its presets), then the ~36 that need surrounding data.
- **Feature-dictionary quests (same day):** CheckShopExistence, CheckOpeningHoursSigned and AddPlaceName
  call `getFeature`. The engine builds SC's own: osmfeatures 8.0.0 (JVM build) over SC's preset files,
  in the JVM locale, pinned to en-CA like the time zone. Oracle again exact: 55,271 Toronto quests for
  all 12 ports. The app's locale is a knob like the resurvey multiplier, but it only decides whether a
  feature has a name; en-CA is the assumption for every city.
- **New quests show as a break, not a jump.** Only the newest snapshot (2026-10-11) was recounted; older
  ones keep `null` for the new quests. The site marks where the set of counted quests changes on the
  totals chart, and the "since last snapshot" tile compares the same quest types on both dates.

## Area quests (2026-10-12, decided while the owner was away)

- **36 more custom quests**, the ones that need the surrounding map data, are counted. Only AddHousenumber,
  AddCycleway and AddRoofShape remain: they need SC's country metadata (`CountryInfo` from the
  `country_metadata` files plus the boundaries), the next step.
- **Generated ports.** `engine/port_area_quests.py` copies each quest file and drops only the UI and answer
  members; output and pins as for the hand ports. Generated, so a version bump is a rerun, not a rewrite.
- **The unit is the app's download tile (z16), not the city.** The app runs `getApplicableElements` on the
  data of one download; a whole city as one map data is a model of nobody's phone, and SC's quests are not
  written for it (AddMaxHeight is quadratic in roads x bridges and took over ten minutes on Toronto). Per
  tile, the counts match the app's behaviour after a one-tile download, and Toronto's per-tile and
  per-city counts differ by one quest in four quests checked.
- **Oracle again**: city mode on Guelph, Kingston and Barrie (29,786 quests) gives identical sets with SC's
  own classes. It found one real bug: a quest returning an element twice was counted twice.
- Cost: the run goes from about 25 s to about 2 minutes and needs a 24 GB heap. Fine for a daily job.
