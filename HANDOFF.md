# Handoff: StreetComplete open-quest statistics per city

## Goal
Build a public website that graphs **open StreetComplete quests per city over time, broken down by quest type**. As far as we know, nothing like it exists. jmizv's sc-quest-stats on Codeberg is a static, single-city Markdown snapshot. Pilot city: **Toronto**.

## What the site should answer
- How many quests of each type are open in city X right now?
- How has that changed over time? Which types are being solved, which are piling up?
- How do cities compare, normalized so size doesn't dominate?
- Where in the city is a given quest type concentrated? (stretch goal: map/heatmap)

## High-level goals
1. **Reuse StreetComplete's own quest definitions.** Don't hand-write Overpass queries. Most quest types declare an element filter string in their Kotlin source (`streetcomplete/StreetComplete`, `quests/**`). Extract and parse those so the tool stays in sync with app releases. Pin the app version used for each data run.
2. **Be honest about coverage.** Some quests aren't pure tag filters: resurvey intervals based on `check_date` age, country-specific enablement, geometry or nearby-feature checks. Classify each quest type as *supported*, *approximated* or *unsupported*, and show that classification on the site.
3. **Daily snapshot pipeline.** Pull a regional extract (Geofabrik Ontario to start), evaluate the filters, count per city boundary (`admin_level=8` or equivalent) per quest type, and append to a time-series store. The pipeline must be idempotent and cheap enough to run on a schedule.
4. **Normalize.** Store raw counts plus denominators (km of road, element counts) so cities can be compared fairly.
5. **Separate the "aging" signal from the "mapping" signal.** Resurvey quests reopen without any edit. Track them separately so the graphs don't mislead.
6. **Simple static frontend.** Charts per city and per quest type, with a city selector and a quest-type filter. Static hosting is preferred: generate JSON and serve from GitHub Pages or similar.
7. **Designed to scale out.** Adding a city or region should be configuration, not code.

## Non-goals (for now)
- Counting *solved* quests from changesets (possible later via the `StreetComplete:quest_type` changeset tag)
- Per-user stats or leaderboards
- Real-time updates

## Suggested first milestone
Toronto only, about 10 common quest types whose filters are simple, a few weeks of daily snapshots, and one chart page. Then extend to the full quest list and more Ontario cities.

## Context
- Owner is an experienced OSM contributor with existing Toronto/Ontario OSM tooling in sibling folders (e.g. ../toronto-streets-layer, ../toronto-addresses-layer, ../toronto-buildings-3d, ../osm-mayflies). Reuse conventions (Python + .venv, README/DESIGN/PRIOR-ART docs) and boundary data where it makes sense.
- Open questions for the owner: preferred stack (Python/osmium vs PostGIS vs Java), hosting, and whether to coordinate with jmizv or the StreetComplete developers early.

## Corrections (2026-10-11)
- "Nothing like it exists" is too strong: **starsep/StreetCompleteStats** publishes solved/all per quest per
  Polish city daily (25 quests, bounding boxes, no history on the site). See PRIOR-ART.md.
- jmizv's queries are not tied to one city, and its QUESTS.md has a "Pending" (open) column.
- Toronto is **admin_level 6** (relation 324211), not 8. Configure cities by relation id.

## Status and next steps (2026-10-13)

Milestone 1 is done and the site is live at https://skfd.github.io/sc-open-quests/. It covers every
Canadian municipality over 50,000 people (111 cities in nine provinces) and Germany's city-states, and all
quest types of SC v64.0 that the app offers there, monthly from 2017-01 and daily since 2026-10.
`kk-SCOpenQuests` runs daily at 13:15. Design and known gaps are in DESIGN.md.

**Repinned to SC v64.0 on 2026-10-21** (DESIGN.md, "Repin to StreetComplete v64.0"; the routine is
REPIN.md). 193 quest types, all counted and oracle-checked (Guelph and Bremerhaven). Merged into main
the same evening, after the Canada work below; the newest extract of every region was recounted with
v64.0 at once, and the overnight job recounts the rest. From then on the scheduled update's last step
opens a GitHub issue "Repin to StreetComplete vX.Y" when the app moves on.

**Canada joined on 2026-10-21** (DESIGN.md, "Regions: the rest of Canada"): 63 cities, every
municipality over 50,000 in the 2021 census that was not yet counted, in eight new regions (Quebec,
British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and
Labrador, one Geofabrik extract each) plus the five Ontario ones the farmland list lacked. Their monthly
history is counted overnight by `.scratch/canada-backfill.sh` (started 21:05 on 2026-10-21; its output
went to a hidden console, not to `logs/canada-backfill.log`, so read progress from
`data/backfill/<region>/snapshots/`, oldest region Quebec first, Ontario's and Germany's recounts in
`data/backfill/<region>/recount/`; a rerun writes the log: `bash .scratch/canada-backfill.sh >
logs/canada-backfill.log 2>&1 &`), which
also recounts Ontario's and Germany's published snapshots with v64.0, merges, rebuilds the history and
commits "data 2017-01-01 to 2026-10-01: monthly history of the Canadian cities outside Ontario; ..."
locally; the next scheduled run pushes it. It runs about a day (a Quebec month about 2 min, an Ontario
recount about 5 min, 117 months each) and pauses around the 13:15 slot. Check that commit exists and
that Montreal's and Vancouver's lines reach back to 2017; if the log ends in an error, rerun the script
(every step skips what is done). The territories are not counted: Whitehorse (28k), Yellowknife (20k)
and Iqaluit (7k) are under the bar, and Nunavut's extract alone is 1.4 GB.

**Germany's city-states joined on 2026-10-13** (DESIGN.md, "Regions"): Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen and
Bremerhaven, because Ontario's totals barely move and Germany is where SC is used most. Each region is a
Geofabrik extract (`config/regions.json`); the daily run counts all four regions. Their monthly history
was counted that evening by `.scratch/germany-backfill.sh` (log: `logs/germany-backfill.log`, about 45 s
a Berlin month); it commits "data 2017-01-01 to 2026-10-01: monthly history of Berlin, …" locally and the
next scheduled run pushes it. Check that commit exists and the German lines go down; if the log ends in an
error, rerun the script (every step skips what is done).

Next, in order:
1. **Check the first scheduled runs.** A run on 2026-10-12 00:50 committed and pushed "data 2026-10-11"
   (`logs/scheduler.log`). The 13:15 slot fired on its own on 2026-10-12 (no new extract, exit 0); still
   watch the first one that counts a new extract per city (about 4 minutes).
   **Since notes (2026-10-12), day D is counted only with the notes dump of D+1**, and the S3 mirror
   the dump redirects to lagged it by more than 14 hours (261012 made ~04:30 UTC, still 404 at 19:10
   UTC). At 13:15 (17:15 UTC) that dump is probably not there yet, so data for day D lands on D+2. Watch
   the first runs (`logs/scheduler.log`: "no notes dump reaches ..."); if it is always a day behind, add
   a second, evening slot. A run raises once an extract has waited 3 days.
2. **Custom quests are done.** All 51 (52 since v64.0) are counted and checked exactly against SC (engine/README.md,
   "Custom quests" and "Area quests"; the last three use SC's country metadata per position). Left:
   - the note quest. Done 2026-10-12 (DESIGN.md, "Notes"), with the hiding below.
   The area unit is the whole city since 2026-10-12 (DESIGN.md, "Area unit").
3. **Deeper history: published 2026-10-13** ("data 2017-01-01 to 2026-10-10"). The site has 123
   snapshots per city: the 1st of every month 2017-01 to 2026-10 from the planet history
   (`tools/backfill_history.py`, DESIGN.md "Monthly history"), plus the dailies, all with notes and all 51
   custom quests. The final pass (log: `logs/backfill-final.log`) took about 4.5 minutes a month, not 2,
   and ran 04:00 to 11:02. It also stored the resurvey settings 0.5 and 2, "show all notes" and the z14
   tile grids (`data/grid/`); DESIGN.md, "Resurvey settings…". `data/backfill/` can be pruned of the
   superseded `nonotes/` and `notes-only/` passes and the slice .pbf files.
   The published 2026-10-11 lacks notes, so the chart shows a break there; `run.py` recounts it from its
   stored extract once a notes dump reaches it.
   Toronto's AddHousenumber went public with its two steps: +293k from 2019-01 to 2019-02 and −277k
   from 2026-05 to 2026-06. Neither is a counting error. The 2026 drop is the owner's own Toronto
   address import (confirmed 2026-10-13); the 2019 rise looks like a building import, unconfirmed.
   Worth a note on the site.
4. **Outreach.** Now that there is something to show, contact starsep (StreetCompleteStats), the SC devs and jmizv.
5. **Site, 2026-10-21:** the reader ticks the quests that count towards the totals and pins quests
   to chart them; the "off by default" checkbox is gone; the whole view lives in the query string so a
   link reproduces it across app releases (DESIGN.md, "Selection, pins and the link"). Drive-through
   check: `.scratch/drive.py` is not kept; `tests/fixtures/screenshot.py` takes the query now.
6. **Smaller items:**
   - ~~Model open OSM notes, since the app hides quests at a note's position.~~ Done 2026-10-12.
   - ~~Write down the routine for SC version bumps.~~ Done 2026-10-21: REPIN.md, used for v64.0.
   - ~~Make the site look like StreetComplete; show app releases on the timeline.~~ Done 2026-10-13
     (DESIGN.md, "Site look").
   - Heatmap per quest type (stretch goal).

## Planet coverage (asked 2026-10-24)

The owner asked for planet coverage. The measurements are in DESIGN.md, "Planet coverage: what was
measured". **The owner chose a direction the same evening** (DESIGN.md, "Planet coverage: the owner's
direction"): the site is for players; every place on Earth gets a name, and only places the community
asks for get counted; Wandrer.earth's nested regions are the model, down to neighbourhoods inside a
city; cities keep today's population bar for now. Next is a new session that explores that breakdown,
including whether Wandrer's regions can be the data source. History is monthly since 2017 and the world is
counted weekly from one planet file (DESIGN.md, same section); disk is the owner's, later. Still open:
whether land outside cities counts. Independent of the answer: GitHub Pages' 1 GB cap is about nine
months away at today's size, so the publish format has to change anyway.

**Taken by the measuring session (2026-10-24 evening), all independent of how places are named:**
the publish format for the Pages cap (newest snapshot per region in `docs/`, the archive outside it, a
small per-quest compare file); every SC country_metadata file bundled and a missing one an error; a
region's extract separate from its id, so several runs can share one extract; the notes clip in one
pass for many polygons; Unicode-safe city ids; and whether `osmium apply-changes --with-history` can keep
the planet history file current. Not taken: the place breakdown, the city list, any planet download.
For the breakdown session: sub-city counts (neighbourhoods) should sum quest positions inside the
city's run (the z14 grid or finer), not run neighbourhoods as small cities; a smaller map data changes
the area quests' counts (DESIGN.md, "Area unit: the whole city").
